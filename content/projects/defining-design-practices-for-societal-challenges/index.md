In this project—executed during the development of the *['Publieke Ontwerppraktijk'](https://www.depubliekeontwerppraktijk.nl)* programme—we provide an initial attempt to define what design practices can bring to working on complex societal challenges. In this project we addressed the three elements of the question central to to be developed program: *how do we increase the impact of a design approach on societal challenges?* We delve into the following questions: what makes working on societal challenges so challenging, how can a design approach contribute to it, and what is necessary to enhance the impact of that approach?
