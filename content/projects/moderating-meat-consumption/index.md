This project explored how we can moderate our meat consumption—while being sensitive to people’s values and traditions. After investigating how people shopped and what causes their behaviour—I am now working on an interactive shopping buddy to help people stay true to their long-term beliefs.

I started out by sending cultural probes to users in order to investigate their shopping and dinner patterns—using a map of the city, recipe cards, a dinner diary and a map of the supermarket. I analysed the results and found that many people decide on what they want to eat once they are in the supermarket.

I observed people in the supermarket  to see what their behaviour is, and what kind of interactions play a role. Here I saw that shopping is a process that consists of both conscious and unconscious actions.

In order to quickly test different variations of intervention mechanisms, I simulated a supermarket by making cards and lay them on a table. This way I could study users interactions more in depth—and let them do the shopping multiple times in a row.

The problem is that people want to make a change, but once they are unprepared in the supermarket they often lapse into their old behaviour. That is why I want intentional flexitarians to feel supported in pursuing their long-term values while shopping their dinner.

Using rough prototypes I explored some working principles that could help achieving my design goal. I quickly found that people do not like to be told what to do, instead be in charge of their own decisions. There should be a dialog between the design intervention and the user—like a buddy helping you in the supermarket.

I am now prototyping and design a scanmaatje that can help people in the supermarket in making decisions that are in line with their values—by picking a character for the groceries scanner that they feel comfortable with. The rest of the process still needs to be added, but here is a glimpse of the final concept.
