## About me
I'm a designer and researcher working at the Delft University of Technology. As a designer and researcher I try to understand how designers can foster systemic change in society through the act of design. I do this on the one hand by integrating various fields of research to understand and support the design process, and on the other hand by working on real-world social issues by turning theory into concrete design artefacts. In my free time I am an avid collector of books and recordsâ€”as well as reading and [listening](https://www.last.fm/user/thvanarkel) {{< last-played >}} to them.

## Work in progress
I am currently finalising several projects, among them a project {{< post-link href="/projects/a-precarious-equilibrium" value="A precarious equilibrium" >}} where we explore  a new approach to interactions between professionals and people with temporary disability benefits, focusing on self-awareness and collaborative decision-making to stimulate a more sustainable road to employment. Next to that I am finishing an article on {{< post-link href="/projects/defining-design-practices-for-societal-challenges" value="Defining design practices for societal challenges" >}} where we explore the repertoire that designers bring to the table when working on complex societal issues.
