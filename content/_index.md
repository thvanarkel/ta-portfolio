I am Thomas van Arkel, a design/researcher from Rotterdam who works at the intersection of design and research for societal change.

## About me
I'm a designer and researcher working at the Delft University of Technology. As a designer and researcher I try to understand how designers can foster systemic change in society through the act of design. I do this on the one hand by integrating various fields of research to understand and support the design process, and on the other hand by working on real-world social issues by turning theory into concrete design artefacts. In my free time I am an avid collector of books and recordsâ€”as well as reading and [listening](https://www.last.fm/user/thvanarkel) {{< last-played >}} to them.

## Work in progress
I am currently working on a project where we explore {{< post-link href="/projects/synergistic-collaborations-safety-sector" value="Building synergistic collaborations" >}}, where we explore how the cooperation between the creative industry and the public security sector can be improved, as well as on a project that aims to understand the role of frames on human behaviour during reintegration processes. Next to that I am partly involved in a research project in which we try to understand what reasoning patterns designers use while reframing issues.
