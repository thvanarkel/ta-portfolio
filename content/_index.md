I am Thomas van Arkel, a design/researcher from Rotterdam who works at the intersection of design and research for societal change.

Currently design researcher at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/)

## About me
I'm a designer and researcher working at the Delft University of Technology. As a designer and researcher I try to understand how designers can effectuate societal change through their designs. I do this by synthesising various fields of research for understanding the act of design, and through turning abstract theories and models into concrete representations of ideas by performing experiments, such as in {{< post-link href="/projects/data-informed-design-experiments" value="Data-Informed Design Experiments" >}}. In my free time I am an avid collector of books and recordsâ€”as well as reading and [listening](https://www.last.fm/user/thvanarkel) {{< last-played >}} to them.


## Work in progress
I am currently working on a project where we explore {{< post-link href="/projects/synergistic-collaborations-safety-sector" value="Synergistic collaborations in the safety sector" >}}, where we explore how the cooperation between the creative industry and the public safety sector can be improved, as well as on a project that aims to understand the role of frames on human behaviour during reintegration processes. Next to that I am partly involved in a research project in which we try to understand what reasoning patterns designers use while reframing issues.
